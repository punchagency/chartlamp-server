5 STATEMENTS: 6
7 Party #1 (P-1, Goree) was contacted at the scene and was identified by her Arizona driver's
8 license as Nalini Selena Goree, DOB: 11-5-1996. P-1 stated that she was driving Vehicle #1 (V-1,
9 Chevy) in the northbound lane of Escalon Bellota Road, north of Carter Road at 60-63 miles per
10 hour. She saw a silver truck (V-2, Ford) traveling ahead of her. She did not see V-2 signal or see
11 V-2 slowing down. V-2 did not appear to be turning. By the time she realized it was, it was too
12 late. The front of V-1 collided with the rear of V-2. V-1 then came to a stop within the lane.
13
14 Party #2 (P-2, Maldonado) was contacted at the scene and was identified by his Mexican
15 identification card as Jesus Prado Maldonado, DOB: 2-24-1975. P-2 stated that he was driving
16 Vehicle #2 (V-2, Ford) in the northbound lane of Escalon Bellota Road, north of Carter Road and
17 had stopped for a minute, waiting for oncoming traffic so he could turn left. He had his left turn
18 signal on. Next thing he knew, a vehicle (V-1, Chevy) hit him. V-2 then came to a stop within the
19 lane.

21 OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: 22
23 AREA OF IMPACT (AOI): 24
25 The AOI of Vehicle #1 (V-1, Chevy) vs. Vehicle #2 (V-2, Ford) was located 6 feet west of the east
26 roadway edge of Escalon Bellota Road and 625 feet north of the north roadway edge of Carter

29 SUMMARY/CAUSE: 30
31 Party #1 (P-1, Goree) was driving Vehicle #1 (V-1, Chevy) northbound on Escalon Bellota Road,
32 north of Carter Road at 60-63 miles per hour. Party #2 (P-2, Maldonado) was driving Vehicle #2
33 (V-2, Ford) northbound Escalon Bellota Road, north of Carter Road and was stopped, waiting to
34 turn. P-1 failed to stop for stopped traffic ahead (22350 CVC). The front of V-1 collided with the
35 rear of V-2 (AOI #1). Following the collision, both vehicles came to a stop within the roadway,
36 where they were located upon CHP arrival.

AFTER CARE INSTRUCTIONS
The examination, treatment and interpretation of diagnostic studies and laboratory tests you received in the emergency
department have been provided to you on an emergency basis only and should not be considered to be a substitute for
comprehensive, all-inclusive medical care. Any specialty tests (e.g., EKG, x-rays, etc.) that you may have been provided
have been interpreted by the Emergency Physician on a preliminary basis. You will be notified promptly of any findings
that we feel are significant. A copy of your medical record and the results of any laboratory and other diagnostic
studies are available to your follow-up doctor upon request. Your follow-up physician should evaluate you for any new
or continuing problems because it is impossible to recognize and treat all elements of injury or illness in an emergency
department visit. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR CONDITION HAS WORSENED OR NEW PROBLEMS DEVELOP, PLEASE
RETURN TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR SEE YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.
Take this sheet with you to your physician on your next visit.
Your medication list is based on information given by or verified by you (patient) and your family or other sources. It is
not meant to substitute for advice/directions given by the prescribing physician, your pharmacist or primary care
physician. Please contact them with questions. Discard old lists and update any records with all medication providers or
retail pharmacies. Check with your physician before continuing over-the-counter medications, herbals and/or
supplements.
* Do not drive, drink alcohol, or operate machinery for at least 8 hours if you received narcotic or sedative medications.
PUBLIC SERVICE INFORMATION:
CHILD SAFETY LAWS
California Law (Vehicle Code 27632.5) requires any child under the age of 8 or less than 4 feet 9 inches tall to be

ANTIBIOTIC MEDICINE
Antibiotic medicines are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. They work by injuring or killing the bacteria that
are making you sick. It is important to know that resistance to antibiotics is a growing problem. If taken improperly,
antibiotics are more likely to cause resistance in bacteria. Take the prescribed antibiotic exactly as your healthcare
professional tells you: for as long as prescribed and in the dose prescribed.

Información adjunta
Acute Back Pain Adult (SPANISH)
Dolor de espalda agudo en los adultos
Acute Back Pain, Adult
El dolor de espalda agudo es repentino y por lo general no dura mucho tiempo. Se debe generalmente a una lesión de
los músculos y tejidos de la espalda. La lesión puede ser el resultado de:
Estiramiento en exceso o desgarro de un músculo, tendón o ligamento. Los ligamentos son tejidos que conectan
los huesos. Levantar algo de forma incorrecta puede producir un esguince de espalda.
Desgaste (degeneración) de los discos vertebrales. Los discos vertebrales son tejidos circulares que proporcionan
amortiguación entre los huesos de la columna vertebral (vértebras).
Movimientos de giro, como al practicar deportes o realizar trabajos de jardinería.
Un golpe en la espalda.
Artritis.
Es posible que le realicen un examen físico, análisis de laboratorio u otros estudios de diagnóstico por imágenes para
encontrar la causa del dolor. El dolor de espalda agudo generalmente desaparece con reposo y cuidados en la casa.
Siga estas instrucciones en su casa:
Control del dolor, la rigidez y la hinchazón
Use los medicamentos de venta libre y los recetados solamente como se lo haya indicado el médico. El
tratamiento puede incluir medicamentos para el dolor y la inflamación que se toman por la boca o que se aplican
sobre la piel, o relajantes musculares.
El médico puede recomendarle que se aplique hielo durante las primeras 24 a 48 horas después del comienzo del
dolor. Para hacer esto:
Ponga el hielo en una bolsa plástica.
Coloque una toalla entre la piel y la bolsa.
Aplique el hielo durante 20 minutos,
2 o 3 veces por día.
Retire el hielo si la piel se pone de color rojo brillante. Esto es muy importante. Si no puede sentir dolor, calor
o frío, tiene un mayor riesgo de que se dañe la zona.
Si se lo indican, aplique calor en la zona afectada con la frecuencia que le haya indicado el médico. Use la fuente
de calor que el médico le recomiende, como una compresa de calor húmedo o una almohadilla térmica.
Coloque una toalla entre la piel y la fuente de calor.
Aplique calor durante 20 a 30 minutos.
Retire la fuente de calor si la piel se pone de color rojo brillante. Esto es especialmente importante si
no
puede sentir dolor, calor o frío. Corre un mayor riesgo de sufrir quemaduras.

After Visit Summary (AVS) (continued)
No permanezca en la cama. Hacer reposo en la cama por más de 1 a 2 días puede demorar su recuperación.
Mantenga una buena postura al sentarse y pararse. No se incline hacia adelante al sentarse ni se encorve al
pararse.
Si trabaja en un escritorio, siéntese cerca de este para no tener que inclinarse. Mantenga el mentón hacia
abajo. Mantenga el cuello hacia atrás y los codos flexionados en un ángulo de 90 grados (ángulo recto).
Cuando conduzca, siéntese elevado y cerca del volante. Agregue un apoyo para la espalda (lumbar) al asiento
del automóvil, si es necesario.
Realice caminatas cortas en superficies planas tan pronto como le sea posible. Trate de caminar un poco más de
tiempo cada día.
No se siente, conduzca o permanezca de pie en un mismo lugar durante más de 30 minutos seguidos. Pararse o
sentarse durante largos períodos de tiempo puede sobrecargar la espalda.
No conduzca ni use maquinaria pesada mientras toma analgésicos recetados.
Use técnicas apropiadas para levantar objetos. Cuando se inclina y levanta un objeto, utilice posiciones que no
sobrecarguen tanto la espalda:
Flexione las rodillas.
Mantenga la carga cerca del cuerpo.
No se tuerza.
Haga actividad física habitualmente como se lo haya indicado el médico. Hacer ejercicios ayuda a que la espalda
sane más rápido y ayuda a evitar las lesiones de la espalda al mantener los músculos fuertes y flexibles.
Trabaje con un fisioterapeuta para crear un programa de ejercicios seguros, según lo recomiende el médico. Haga
ejercicios como se lo haya indicado el fisioterapeuta.
Estilo de vida
Mantenga un peso saludable. El sobrepeso sobrecarga la espalda y hace que resulte difícil tener una buena
postura.
Evite actividades o situaciones que lo hagan sentirse ansioso o estresado. El estrés y la ansiedad aumentan la
tensión muscular y pueden empeorar el dolor de espalda. Aprenda formas de manejar la ansiedad y el estrés,
como a través del ejercicio.

Instrucciones generales
Duerma sobre un colchón firme en una posición cómoda. Intente acostarse de costado, con las rodillas
ligeramente flexionadas. Si se recuesta sobre la espalda, coloque una almohada debajo de las rodillas.
Mantenga la cabeza y el cuello en línea recta con la columna vertebral (posición neutra) cuando use equipos
electrónicos como teléfonos inteligentes o tablets. Para hacer esto:
Levante el teléfono inteligente o la tablet para mirarlo en lugar de inclinar la cabeza o el cuello para mirar
hacia abajo.
Coloque el teléfono inteligente o la tablet al nivel de su cara mientras mira la pantalla.
Siga el plan de tratamiento como se lo haya indicado el médico. Esto puede incluir:
Terapia cognitiva o conductual.
Acupuntura o terapia de masajes.
Yoga o meditación.
Comuníquese con un médico si:
Siente un dolor que no se alivia con reposo o medicamentos.
Siente mucho dolor que se extiende a las piernas o las nalgas.
El dolor no mejora luego de 2 semanas.
Siente dolor por la noche.
Pierde peso sin proponérselo.
Tiene fiebre o escalofríos.
Siente náuseas o vómitos.
Siente dolor abdominal.
Solicite ayuda de inmediato si:
Tiene nuevos problemas para controlar la vejiga o los intestinos.
Siente debilidad o adormecimiento inusuales en los brazos o en las piernas.
Siente que va a desmayarse.
Estos síntomas pueden representar un problema grave que constituye una emergencia. No espere a ver si los
síntomas desaparecen. Solicite atención médica de inmediato. Comuníquese con el servicio de emergencias de
su localidad (911 en los Estados Unidos). No conduzca por sus propios medios hasta el hospital.
Resumen
El dolor de espalda agudo es repentino y por lo general no dura mucho tiempo.
Use técnicas apropiadas para levantar objetos. Cuando se inclina y levanta un objeto, utilice posiciones que no
sobrecarguen tanto la espalda.
Tome los medicamentos de venta libre y los recetados solamente como se lo haya indicado el médico, y aplíquese
calor o hielo según las indicaciones.
Esta información no tiene como fin reemplazar el consejo del médico. Asegúrese de hacerle al médico cualquier
pregunta que tenga.

ED COURSE/MDM
Jesus Prado is a 48 year old male Pt presents after a MVA with neck, upper back, and back pain. Pt was a restraint
Driver. Pt denies striking head to the dashboard but backwards to the head rest. No actual LOC, but was dazed after
the initial accident he was in shock. No airbags deployed. Pt walked out of the car by themselves. Normal appearing
without signs or symptoms of serious injury. Denies taking any blood thinners. Some midline cervical spine
tenderness and sensitivity on exam. Pt was placed in a cervical spine collar. Low suspicious for ICH or other
intracranial traumatic injury. No seat-built signs or abdominal ecchymosis to indicate concerns for serious trauma to
thorax or abdomen. Pelvis without evidence of injury and patient is neurologically intact. Explained to Pt that they
will
likely be sore for the coming days and can use Tylenol or Ibuprofen as needed for pain. CT head and CT cervical
spine, as well as CXR, are unremarkable. Pt/family was advised to return to ED or call 911 if any signs and symptoms
concerning head injury such as excessive sleepiness, difficulty waking up or arousing Pt, abnormal behaviors, nausea
or vomiting, increased headaches, change in vision, unilateral weakness, slurred speech, or facial asymmetry. Pain
medications as needed, muscle relaxers for lower back spasm as needed.
Pt is not in need of any emergent medical intervention at this time. Patient is stable for discharge home and treatment
as outpatient. Patient was advised to follow up with Primary physician in 3 days for further evaluation, needed
treatment, and a referral to specialist if indicated by PMD. Patient was advised to come back to ED if symptoms not
improved, new, or worsening of existing symptoms in the next 24 hours. Pt was also advised to return to ED for a
follow up if does not have a PMD, or unable to establish a follow up appt in the next 24 - 72 hours. See discharge
instructions for more detailed return to ED criteria and discharge teaching. Patient was educated on disease process

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN'S REPORT
PATIENT:
Jesus Prado Maldonado
FILE #: 33960
DATE OF INJURY: 5/16/2023
DATE OF EXAM: 6/21/2023
To Whom It May Concern:
The following is an attending physician's report in regards to Jesus Prado Maldonado as it relates
to his involvement as the driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in an accident that occurred
on 5/16/2023.
HISTORY OF ACCIDENT: At approximately 5: 40 AM on 5/16/2023 Jesus Prado Maldonado
was the driver of a 1997 Ford F-150 traveling north on Escalon Bellota Road at Copperopolis Road
in Farmington, CA. He describes the weather as clear and the road conditions as dry at that time.
As his vehicle was stopped waiting to turn left it was suddenly and unexpectedly struck from
behind, by a Chevrolet Equinox, in what he described as a 'rear end' type collision. At the time of
the impact, he was looking straight ahead. His hands were both on the steering wheel and his foot
was on the brake. Both his seat belt and shoulder belt were securely fastened. The patient is unsure
if his head impacted or overrode the head rest during the impact. The airbags in his vehicle did not
deploy. Immediately following the accident, he reports feeling nervous, shocked, and in pain at his
neck.
An ambulance was called to the scene of the accident. He was examined by Emergency Medical
Personnel but was not treated. He was transported by his daughter in law to Sutter Health Memorial
Medical Center that night because of neck pain, headache head pain, left shoulder pain, and a
"bump" at the back of his head. At Sutter Health Memorial Medical Center, the patient was
examined. He states that CT imaging studies of his head were obtained. The patient was prescribed
medications for inflammation and pain. The patient reports that he has not received any other care
since the accident.
The police were notified, and a police report was done. There was 1 other passenger in the vehicle
at the time of the accident. There were other injuries in the accident to his wife. The patient's
vehicle was able to be driven from the scene. He reports missing 25 days of work as a farm worker

--- Page 51 ---
due to this accident. He describes an average workday as kneeling, pushing, pulling, lifting, and
standing for long periods.
The patient reports that his daily activities that are affected include: lifting, pulling, and turning
his head. He is currently unaware of any restrictions to activities that he was able to do prior to the
accident.
He describes the pain as throbbing, and sharp. He feels it has gotten worse since the accident.
CHIEF COMPLAINTS: Complaints of pain were measured using a visual analog scale with 10
representing the greatest degree of discomfort. Since the accident he has experienced frequent
headache rated 10, intermittent neck pain rated 10, intermittent upper back pain rated 10, and
intermittent left shoulder pain rated 10.
The patient denies experiencing any complaints prior to this accident.
GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a 48-year-old male.
Palpatory Findings: A grade I tenderness was noted at the cervical, and upper thoracic areas.
