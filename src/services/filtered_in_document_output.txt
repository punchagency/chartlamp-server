CONSENT UPON ADMISSION FOR TREATMENT
I HENRY SHARP do voluntarily consent to the following medical procedure(s): BILATERAL TRANSFORAMINAL LUMBAR
EPIDURAL STEROID INJECTION AT L5-S1.
Treating Doctor and Facility. The procedure will be performed by my Treating Doctor, Dr. Wahba, David ;
at Bahamas Surgery Center. I have been informed that there are physicians who may have ownership in this surgery
center. I understand that I am free to choose another facility in which to receive services. I also understand the surgery
center is (arranging) for the equipment, technical support and clinical staff to be used in performing this procedure.
Basis of Consent. I give this voluntary consent after discussing with my Treating Doctor and agree that the procedure is
an appropriate course of medical treatment. In particular I have discussed with my Treating Doctor my general medical
condition and allergies and I have Informed my Treating Doctor about any medication (including prescription and over-
the-counter medications) that I am currently taking. My Treating Doctor has fully explained the following:
the nature and purpose of the procedure
the material risks of the procedure
the benefits from the procedure
the possibility of complications during the procedure
the alternative treatments and procedures available, and
the consequences of refusing the procedure
I know that I may make requests for additional information about any of the above issues prior to the commencement
of the procedure. I also know medicine and surgery are not exact sciences and that no guarantees can be made
concerning the results of the procedure. My Treating Doctor has obtained my informed consent to the procedure. If I
should have any questions or concerns regarding the nature or results of the procedure or any other examination or
treatment, I understand that I should ask my Treating Doctor.
Consent for Additional Procedures. I also give voluntary consent for any necessary routine diagnostic procedures and
medical treatment performed by my Treating Doctor as part of the above medical procedure. I also consent to the
performance of other unforeseen operations or procedures if my Treating Doctor determines they are required. Such a
situation may arise, for example, If the procedure or surgery discussed above discloses a previously unknown condition
and my Treating Doctor determines, based on medical judgment, the unforeseen operation or procedure is reasonably
necessary to improve or maintain my health. I also understand other necessary medical professionals, designated by my
Treating Doctor, may also participate in my procedure.
Consent to Experimental or Investigational Procedures. My Treating Doctor has fully explained to me that my
procedure or implant may be considered investigational and/or experimental in nature by third party payor(s).
Transportation and Care After the Procedure, I understand that it is my responsibility and I have arranged for a
responsible adult to drive me home and provide assistance following my surgery. I acknowledge that I have been
advised not to drive until the effects of any medications have worn off. I understand this to mean that I should not drive
until the day after my procedure or as directed by my Treating Doctor.

Your Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills
When you get emergency care or are treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network
hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from balance billing. In these cases, you
shouldn't be charged more than your plan's copayments, coinsurance and/or deductible.
What is "balance billing" (sometimes called "surprise billing")?
When you'see a doctor or other health care provider, you may owe certain out-of-pocket costs,like
a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible. You may have additional costs or have to pay the entire
bill If you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn't in your health plan's network.
"Out-of-network" means providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with your health plan
to provide services, Out-of-network providers may be allowed to bill you for the difference between
what your plan pays and the full amount charged for a service. This is lled "balance billing." This
amount is likely more than In-network costs for the same service and night not count toward your
plan's deductible or annual out-of-pocket limit.
"Surprise billing" is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can't control who is
involved in your care-like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an In-
network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network provider. Surprise medical bills
could cost thousands of dollars depending on the procedure or service.
You're protected from balance billing for:
Emergency services
If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an out-of- network
provider or facility, the most they can bill you is your plan's in-network cost-sharing amount (such
as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles). You can't be balance billed for these emergency
services. This includes services you may get after you're in stable condition, unless you give
written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post-stabilization
services.
Certain services at an In-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center
When you get services from an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, certain
providers there may be out-of-network. In these cases, the most those providers can bill you is
your plan's In-network cost-sharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, anesthesia,
pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or Intensivist
services. These providers can't balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections
not to be balance billed.
If you get other types of services at these in-network facilities, out-of-network providers can't
balance bill you, unless you give written consent and give up your protections.

Yog're never required to give up your protections from balance billing.Yo also
aren't required to get out-of-network care. You can choose a provider or facility
in your plan's network.
California: Comprehensive Balance Billing Protections
State requires Insurers to hold enrollees harmless for amounts beyond In-network level of
cost sharing
State prohibits out-of-network providers from billing enrollees for any amount beyond In-
network level of cost sharing
Above protections apply:
To HMO and PPO enrollees
For (1) emergency services by out-of-network professionals and facilities and (2)
non-emergency services provided by out-of-network professionals at in-network
facilities
Provided by all or most classes of health care professionals
State provides a payment standard
Protections do not apply to:
ground ambulance services
enrollees who consent to non-emergency out-of-network services
enrollees in self-funded plans
When balance billing isn't allowed, you also have these protections:
You're only responsible for paying your share of the cost (like the copayments,
coinsurance, and deductible that you would pay if the provider or facility was In-network).
Your health plan will pay any additional costs to out-of-network providers and facilities
directly.
Generally, your health plan must;
Cover emergency services without requiring you to get approval for services in
advance (also known as "prior authorization").
Cover emergency services by out-of-network providers.
Base what you owe the provider, or facility (cost-sharing) on what It would pay an In-
network provider or facility and show that amount In your explanation of benefits.
Count any amount you pay for emergency services or out-of-network
services
toward your In-network deductible and out-of-pocket limit.
If you think you've been wrongly billed, contact the No Surprises Helpdesk at 1-800-985-3059.

Your Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills
When you get emergency care or are treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network
hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from balance billing. In these cases, you
shouldn't be charged more than your plan's copayments, coinsurance and/or deductible.
What is "balance billing" (sometimes called "surprise billing")?
When you see a doctor or other health care provider, you may owe certain out-of-pocket costs, like
a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible. You may have additional costs or have to pay the entire
bill If you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn't in your health plan's network.
"Out-of-network" means providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with your health plan
to provide services. Out-of-network providers may be allowed to bill you for the difference between
what your plan pays and the full amount charged for a service. This is called "balance billing." This
amount is likely more than in-network costs for the same service and might not count toward your
plan's deductible or annual out-of-pocket limit.
"Surprise billing" is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can't control who is
involved in your care-like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an in-
network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network provider. Surprise medical bills
could cost thousands of dollars depending on the procedure or service.
You're protected from balance billing for:
Emergency services
If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an out-of- network
provider or facility, the most they can bill you is your plan's in-network cost-sharing amount (such
as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles). You can't be balance billed for these emergency
services. This includes services you may get after you're in stable condition, unless you give
written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post-stabilization
services.
Certain services at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center
When you get services from an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, certain
providers there may be out-of-network. In these cases, the most those providers can bill you is
your plan's in-network cost-sharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, anesthesia,
pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist
services. These providers can't balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections
not to be balance billed.
If you get other types of services at these in-network facilities, out-of-network providers can't
balance bill you, unless you give written consent and give up your protections.

MRI of the cervical spine performed at SCOI on 1/5/2024 reveals:
FINDINGS:
There is reversal of the normal cervical lordosis. The spinal cord is of normal size and signal
characteristics. There is no extra medullary, intradural abnormalities. There are no cranlocervical
junction abnormalities. Bone marrow signal Intensity is
normal except for Modic type I degenerative endplate changes at C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7. There
are no compression fractures. There are no craniocervical junction abnormalities, Note is made
of a partially empty sella unchanged,
At C1-C2 there is no abnormality.
At C2-C3 there is no loss of disc height, bulge or protrusion, facet hypertrophy, canal or foraminal
stenosis.
At C3-C4 there is mild loss of disc signal with a 2 mm disc bulge which mildly flattens the ventral
thecal sac without canal stenosis.
At C4-C5 there is moderate loss of disc height with a 4 mm disc bulge with osteophyte which mild
to moderately compresses the cord mildly to moderately narrowing the canal. Uncinate
hypertrophy mildly narrows the right and mildly narrows the left neural
foramen.
At C5-C6 there is mild loss of disc signal with a 4 mm left paracentral and lateral recess and
foraminal broad-based protrusion which mildly flattens the left ventral cord. Left uncinate
hypertrophy mild to moderately narrows the left neural foramen and
right uncinate hypertrophy moderate to moderate to severely narrows the right neural foramen,
At C6-C7 there is severe loss of disc height with a 3 to 4 mm disc bulge with osteophyte which
mildly flattens the ventral thecal sac. Uncinate hypertrophy moderate to severely narrows the
right and moderately narrows the left neural foramen. There is no
significant canal stenosis nor cord compression
At C7-T1 there is mild loss of disc signal with a 2 mm anterolisthesis and facet hypertrophy which
mildly narrows the right neural foramen

The alignment is anatomic except for trace lumbar scoliosis with concavity towards the left and
an anterolisthesis of L5 with respect to S1 without congenital spinal stenosis. The conus ends in
normal position without focal enlargement or abnormal
signal. There is no clumping of the intrathecal nerve roots. Bone marrow signal intensity is
normal. There are no compression fractures.
At T12-L1 there is no loss of disc height or signal. There is no bulge or protrusion, facet
hypertrophy, canal or foraminal stenosis.
At L1-L2 there is no loss of disc height or signal. There is no disc bulge or protrusion, facet
hypertrophy, canal or foraminal stenosis.
At L2-3 there is no loss of disc height or signal. There is no disc bulge or protrusion, facet
hypertrophy, canal foraminal stenosis.
At L3-4 there is no loss of disc height or signal. There Is no disc bulge or protrusion, facet
hypertrophy, canal or foraminal stenosis.
At L4-5 there Is mild loss of disc signal with a 3 to 4 mm broad-based protrusion which mildly
flattens the ventral thecal sac without canal stenosis. There is moderate facet hypertrophy with
trace facet effusions. Disc bulge and facet hypertrophy mild
to moderately narrows the left and slightly narrows the right neural foramen.
At L5-S1 there is severe loss of disc height with a 6-7 mm anterolisthesis of L5 with respect to
S1. There is redundant disc protruding cephalad into the neural foramen which severely narrow
the neural foramen right side greater than left Impinging the L5 nerve roots. There are bilateral
chronic pars defects without canal stenosis. Findings are similar to previous.

RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN: An extended amount of time was spent with the patient today
explaining the physical findings, diagnostic findings, current impressions from the physical
examination as well as treatment alternatives that are available.
Cervical radiculopathy
Is scheduled for C5-C6 cervical epidural steroid injection on 07/08/2024,
Mobic 15mg once daily pm for pain control was not refilled today.
Gabapentin 300mg TID for neuropathic pain was not refilled today.
Right shoulder pain
The patient continues with chronic right shoulder pain despite cervical epidural injection he may
be a candidate for an MRI of the right shoulder with contrast to evaluate for possible SLAP tear
his rotator cuff tendinosis.
Lumbar radiculopathy
He is complaining today of right-sided radicular pain along the L5 distribution. MRI shows severe
foraminal stenosis at this level. This is consistent with his clinical complaints. This point
recommend he undergo right-sided L5-S1 transforaminal epidural steroid injection to help
alleviate the radicular symptoms throughout the posterior right leg. The injection is both
diagnostic and therapeutic. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
patient and he is elected to proceed.
Myofascial pain syndrome
Robaxin 750mg BID pm for muscle spasms.
All of the patient's questions and concerns were addressed and answered.
Spinal discomfort and radiculopathy is multifactorial, To complete the evaluation, an examination
was performed and Imaging studies were reviewed. The medical history, review of systems and
medications were reviewed. I assessed spinal and non-spinal causes of symptoms including
musculoskeletal, vascular causes, visceral causes, Infections, endocrine abnormalities,

Your Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills
When you get emergency care or are treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network
hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from balance billing. In these cases, you
shouldn't be charged more than your plan's copayments, coinsurance and/or deductible.
What is "balance billing" (sometimes called "surprise billing")?
When you see a doctor or other health care provider, you may owe certain out-of-pocket costs, like
a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible. You may have additional costs or have to pay the entire
bill If you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn't in your health plan's network.
"Out-of-network" means providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with your health plan
to provide services. Out-of-network providers may be allowed to bill you for the difference between
what your plan pays and the full amount charged for a service. This is called "balance billing." This
amount is likely more than in-network costs for the same service and might not count toward your
plan's deductible or annual out-of-pocket limit.
"Surprise billing" is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can't control who is
involved in your care-like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an in-
network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network provider. Surprise medical bills
could cost thousands of dollars depending on the procedure or service.
You're protected from balance billing for:
Emergency services
If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an out-of-network
provider or facility, the most they can bill you is your plan's in-network cost-sharing amount (such
as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles). You can't be balance billed for these emergency
services. This includes services you may get after you're in stable condition, unless you give
written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post-stabilization
services.
Certain services at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center
When you get services from an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, certain
providers there may be out-of-network. In these cases, the most those providers can bill you is
your plan's in-network cost-sharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, anesthesia,
pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist
services. These providers can't balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections
not to be balance billed.
If you get other types of services at these in-network facilities, out-of-network providers can't
balance bill you, unless you give written consent and give up your protections.

MRI of the cervical spine performed at SCOI on 1/5/2024 reveals:
FINDINGS:
There is reversal of the normal cervical lordosis. The spinal cord is of normal size and signal
characteristics. There is no extra medullary, intradural abnormalities. There are no craniocervice"
junction abnormalities. Bone marrow signal intensity is
normal except for Modic type I degenerative endplate changes at C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7, There
are no compression fractures. There are no craniocervical junction abnormalities, Note is made
of a partially empty sella unchanged.
At C1-C2 there is no abnormality,
At C2-C3 there Is no loss of disc height, bulge or protrusion, facet hypertrophy, canal or foramina:
stenosis.
At C3-C4 there is mild loss of disc signal with a 2 mm disc bulge which mildly flattens the ventral
thecal sac without canal stenosis.
At C4-C5 there Is moderate loss of disc height with a 4 mm disc bulge with osteophyte which mile
to moderately compresses the cord mildly to moderately narrowing the canal. Uncinate
hypertrophy mildly narrows the right and mildly narrows the left neural
foramen.
At C5-C6 there is mild loss of disc signal with a 4 mm left paracentral and lateral recess and
foraminal broad-based protrusion which mildly flattens the left ventral cord, Left uncinate
hypertrophy mild to moderately narrows the left neural foramen and
right uncinate hypertrophy moderate to moderate to severely narrows the right neural forameh:
At C6-C7 there is severe loss of disc helght with a 3 to 4 mm disc bulge with osteophyte which
mildly flattens the ventral thecal sac. Uncinate hypertrophy moderate to severely narrows the
right and moderately narrows the left neural foramen. There Is no
significant canal stenosis nor cord compression
At C7-T1 there is mild loss of disc signal with a 2 mm anterolisthesis and facet hypertrophy which
mildly narrows the right neural foramen

IMPRESSION: At C4-C5 there is a 4 mm disc bulge with osteophyte which mild to moderately
compresses the cord mildly to moderately narrowing the canal. Uncinate hypertrophy mildly
narrows the right and mildly narrows the left neural foramen. Findings are slightly progressive,
At C5-C6 there is a 4 mm left paracentral and lateral recess and foraminal broad-based
protrusion which mildly flattens the left ventral cord. Left uncinate hypertrophy mild to moderately
narrows the left neural foramen and right uncinate hypertrophy
moderate to moderate to severely narrows the right neural foramen. Findings are progressive
At C6-C7 there is a 3 to 4 mm dlsc bulge with osteophyte which mildly flattens the ventral thecal,
sac. Uncinate hypertrophy moderate to severely narrows the right and moderately narrows the
4,1
left neural foramen. Disc bulge mildly flattens the theca
without cord compression or significant canal stenosis.
MRI of the Lumbar Spine performed st SCOI on 1/9/2024 reveals:
FINDINGS:
The alignment Is anatomic except for trace lumbar scoliosis with concavity towards the left and
an anterolisthesis of L5 with respect to S1 without congenital spinal stenosis. The conus ends in
normal position without focal enlargement or abnormal
signal. There is no clumping of the intrathecal nerve roots. Bone marrow signal intensity is
normal. There are no compression fractures.
At T12-L1 there is no loss of disc height or signal. There is no bulge or protrusion, facet
hypertrophy, canal or foraminal stenosis.
At L1-L2 there is no loss of disc height or signal. There is no dlsc bulge or protrusion, facet
hypertrophy, canal or foraminal stenosis,
At L2-3 there is no loss of disc height or signal. There is no disc bulge or protrusion, facet
hypertrophy, canal foraminal stenosis.
At L3-4 there Is no loss of disc height or signal. There is no disc bulge or protrusion, facet
hypertrophy, canal or foraminal stenosis.
At L4-5 there is mild loss of disc signal with a 3 to 4 mm broad-based protrusion which mildly
flattens the ventral thecal sac without canal stenosis, There Is moderate facet hypertrophy with
trace facet effusions, Disc bulge and facet hypertrophy mild
to moderately narrows the left and slightly narrows the right neural foramen.
At L5-S1 there is severe loss of disc height with a 6-7 mm anterolisthesis of L5 with respect to
S1. There is redundant disc protruding cephalad into the neural foramen which severely narrow
the neural foramen right side greater than left implnging the L5 nerve roots. There are bilateral
chronic pars defects without canal stenosis. Findings are similar to previous.

examination as well as treatment alternatives that are available,
Cervical radiculopathy
Is scheduled for C5-C6 cervical epidural steroid injection on 07/08/2024.

hls rotator cuff tendinosis,
Lumbar radiculopathy
He is complaining today of right-sided radicular pain along the L5 distribution. MRI shows sever
foraminal stenosis at this level. This Is consistent with his clinical complaints, This point
recommend he undergo right-sided L5-S1 transforaminal epidural steroid injection to help
alleviate the radicular symptoms throughout the posterior right leg. The injection is both
diagnostic and therapeutic. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
patient and he is elected to proceed.
Myofascial pain syndrome
Robaxin 750mg BID pm for muscle spasms.
All of the patient's questions and concerns were addressed and answered.
Spinal discomfort and radiculopathy is multifactorial. To complete the evaluation, an examination
was performed and Imaging studies were reviewed. The medical history, review of systems and
medications were reviewed. I assessed spinal and non-spinal causes of symptoms Including
musculoskeletal, vascular causes, visceral causes, infections, endocrine abnormalities,
medications, and tumors as the differential dlagnosis of spinal paln is extensive and Includes, bu
