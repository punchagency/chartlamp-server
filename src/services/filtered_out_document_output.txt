Dear Patient,
As of January 1, 2005, the State of California, Office of Statewide Health Planning and
Development (OSHPD) mandates that ambulatory surgery centers collect individual

management of state health care delivery and public health programs, efficient
administration of healthcare services, continuous improvement in the quality of care provided
by hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers, effective procurement of healthcare access and
outcomes. Individually identifiable patient information is protected and encrypted within the
state system.
In addition to information collected at the time when surgery is scheduled, we also need you to
select your race and ethnicity:
RACE:
R1 - American Indian or Alaskan Native
R2- Asian
R3- Black or African American
R4- Native Hawaiian or other Pacific
R5- White
R9- Other Race
